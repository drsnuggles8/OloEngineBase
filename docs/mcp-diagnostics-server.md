# MCP diagnostics server (read-only)

OloEditor can host a **localhost-only, read-only [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
server** so you can point your own LLM agent (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, …) at the
*running editor* and get grounded help debugging your game — using the diagnostics the
engine already collects (logs, scene/ECS state, scripting errors and API, performance,
memory, shaders, assets, crash reports, and a live screenshot).

Strategy is **"expose, don't embed"**: OloEditor does not ship a chat panel, an API key,
or a model. It exposes data over a standard protocol; you bring your own agent. (Issue #285.)

## Security model

- Binds **`127.0.0.1` only** — never a routable interface.
- **Off by default**; you start it explicitly (panel button or an env var).
- Every request must carry a **bearer token** the editor generates and displays. A fresh
  token is minted each time you start the server.
- The `Origin` header is validated (DNS-rebinding defence) and the dispatch layer is
  **read-only** — no tool modifies your project.
- Optional **path redaction** scrubs absolute filesystem paths from text output (toggle in
  the panel) for when you don't want project layout / usernames leaving the process.

## Enabling it

**From the editor UI:** `Window ▸ MCP Server`, set a port (default **7345**), click
**Start server**. The panel then shows the endpoint URL, the auth token, and a ready-to-paste
`claude mcp add` command (with copy buttons).

**For automation / headless:** set `OLO_MCP_AUTOSTART=1` (optionally `OLO_MCP_PORT=<port>`)
before launching OloEditor; the server starts during editor init.

When running, the server writes a **discovery file** to `%TEMP%/oloengine-mcp.json`
(`$TMPDIR` on POSIX) containing the host, port, token, and URL — handy for scripts/agents
that can read it instead of copy-paste. It's removed when the server stops.

## Attaching an agent

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http oloeditor http://127.0.0.1:7345/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN-FROM-THE-PANEL>"
```

(The panel's "Copy command" button produces this exact line with the live token/port.)
Then in a Claude Code session the `olo_*` tools, the `olo://…` resources, and the prompts
are available.

### Claude Desktop

Add the server to `claude_desktop_config.json` (Settings ▸ Developer ▸ Edit Config). For a
build with native Streamable-HTTP MCP support:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "oloeditor": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:7345/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer <TOKEN-FROM-THE-PANEL>" }
    }
  }
}
```

If your Claude Desktop build only speaks stdio, bridge with
[`mcp-remote`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "oloeditor": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "http://127.0.0.1:7345/mcp",
               "--header", "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN-FROM-THE-PANEL>"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop after editing the config. The token changes every time you restart
the server, so update the config (or re-copy from the panel) accordingly.

## What's exposed

### Tools

| Tool | What it returns |
|---|---|
| `olo_log_tail` | recent engine log lines |
| `olo_scene_summary` | active scene name, play state, entity count |
| `olo_scene_list_entities` | paginated entity list (id, name, parent, child count) + name filter |
| `olo_scene_get_entity` | one entity's full component data (YAML) by UUID |
| `olo_perf_snapshot` | fps, frame/CPU/GPU time, draw calls, instancing, triangles |
| `olo_perf_bottlenecks` | CPU/GPU/Memory/IO bottleneck + confidence + recommendations |
| `olo_perf_frame_history` | downsampled recent-frame time series |
| `olo_perf_capture_frame` | frame breakdown: passes + top-K draw calls by GPU time |
| `olo_memory_report` | GPU/CPU memory total + per-type breakdown + suspected leaks |
| `olo_shader_errors` | shaders with compile/link errors |
| `olo_shader_get` | one shader's uniforms/buffers/samplers/instructions (+ optional GLSL) |
| `olo_assets_list` | paginated registered assets (handle, type, path) + type filter |
| `olo_script_get_api` | C# / Lua scripting API digest (types + members), with a type filter |
| `olo_script_get_last_errors` | recent C# (Mono) / Lua (Sol2) script exceptions |
| `olo_crash_list` / `olo_crash_get` | crash reports under `CrashReports/` |
| `olo_screenshot` | the viewport rendered to a PNG image block |

### Resources

- `olo://scene/current` — the whole active scene serialized to YAML.
- `olo://logs/recent` — the recent engine log lines.

### Prompts (canned workflows)

- `diagnose-performance` — why is the scene slow, and what to fix.
- `explain-last-script-error` — explain the most recent script exception and fix it.
- `why-cant-i-see-my-object` — figure out why an entity isn't visible.

## Threading note

Diagnostics that are already mutex-guarded (logs, memory tracker) are read directly. Reads of
the EnTT registry / scene / renderer profiler are **marshaled onto the editor's main thread at
a frame boundary** (the registry is not thread-safe), so every scene/perf read returns a
consistent frame snapshot. If the editor is unresponsive, such a tool times out (~5 s) rather
than blocking it.
