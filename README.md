# OloEngine
OloEngine is primarily an early-stage interactive application and rendering engine for Windows based on [Hazel](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel/).

## Getting Started
Requirements:
- Python 3.10+, with the 'jinja2' package installed (needed for building glad2)
- CMake 3.25+ (soon 4.2+ needed for Visual Studio 2026 support)
- Vulkan SDK (for SPIR-V shader compilation)

You can clone the repository to a local destination using git:

`git clone https://github.com/drsnuggles8/OloEngineBase`

This project uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) to build the project's solution files. There's a batch script `scripts/Win-GenerateProject.bat` that will generate the solution file for Visual Studio 2022.

**Visual Studio Code Users:** The project includes predefined VS Code tasks for building and running. Use tasks like `build-sandbox3d-debug`, `run-oloeditor-release`, etc. from the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P → "Tasks: Run Task").

**CLion Users:** Open the OloEngineBase folder, let CLion initialize the CMake project, then edit the run configurations by changing the working directory of the OloEditor application to be the OloEditor folder.

CMake downloads all dependencies via FetchContent and CPM (CMake Package Manager) and stores them in the `OloEngine/vendor/` directory.
CMake will also create the `build/` directory, which contains the Visual Studio solution files.

## Current Features

### Core Engine
